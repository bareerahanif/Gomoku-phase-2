 PHASE 2
 ----------------------------
1) isWin Function:
   Approach 1 (Using Sub-functions):
- Create sub-functions to check for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins for a specific player.
- Combine these sub-functions to create the isWin function that checks if a player has won.
2) Approach 2 (Using Nested Loops):
- Use nested loops to check for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins for a specific player.
- Implement the isWin function using these nested loops.
- isDraw / isFill Function
  - - - - - - - - - -- -- - - -- 
isDraw/IsFill Function:
- Create a function isDraw to check if the game ends in a draw (all cells filled without a win).
- Develop a function isFill to determine if the game board is fully filled.
  
Leaderboard Implementation:
- Create a function to display a sorted leaderboard showing player positions based on their win position.
  
Game Mechanics:
- The functions should work for a game accommodating multiple players.
- The game ends either when a player wins or when it's a draw.
- The leaderboard should show the ranking of players based on their win Position.
